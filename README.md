# 7-1-Final-Project-Submission-Backup-Script
I. Navigate: The first step in this process, which you will provide evidence for in your log file, is to view the following using Linux commands:
A. Current directory
B. Current user
C. Directory contents
II. Command list information: Your next step will be to utilize a resource inside the Linux operating system that can provide you with more information for
how to utilize commands.
A. Utilize a command to access key command information that would inform which command switch to use to show all files in the directory,
including hidden files.
B. Review the directory contents again utilizing a command with a switch that includes hidden files.
III. Locate a file: Locate and open a file in the Linux workspace directory that contains the following text string: lastbackup.
IV. File permissions: Locate the whoownsme.txt file and confirm that all users have the ability to execute the file.
V. Running processes: View all the processes running in the system in order of priority.
VI. Log file: Utilize a Linux command to create a log file that contains all of the commands you have utilized up to this point, and ensure all of the commands
utilized in critical elements I through V are listed. Title this file Bearings_Log_File.txt, and download this file for submission.
Executing tasks: In this section of the project, you will demonstrate your ability to execute Linux commands to create files and create and organize the Linux
directory structure. At the end of this section, you will create a log file that will include a list of all the commands you used to complete these steps.
VII. In the workspace directory, create new directories titled NEW, BACKUP, and OLD.
VIII. Create files: For this section, you will need to create files using five different methods in preparation for scripting in the following section. Ensure that
you place them in the directory titled “NEW”:
A. A text file with five lines of text that you chose, titled Personal_Content.txt
B. A text file listing the quantity of operating system free space, titled Free_Space_Content.txt
C. A text file listing the directory contents of your workspace directory and showing all file permissions, titled Directory_Content.txt
D. A text file with the concatenated output of the Directory_Content.txt file (title the new file Copied_Content.txt.)
E. A text file showing the current month, day, and time (title this file Time_File.txt.)
IX. Modify and copy files: Utilize Linux commands to rename files and copy them to a different directory in preparation for the backup script in the
following section. Rename the files by adding the suffix “_OLD” to them, and copy the files from the “NEW” directory to the “OLD” directory. Remember
that your modified files should use an appropriate naming convention: XXXX_XXXX_OLD.txt. Ensure that your modified files reside in the OLD directory,
and that your original files reside in the NEW directory.
X. Log file: Create a log file of all the commands you have utilized up to this point. Title this file Tasks_Log_File.txt, and download it for submission.
Script: In this section of your final project, you will write a basic script to create and back up files. You will create this script with the vi editor. The script will
combine multiple commands and simplify a repeatable task. Your script should be named Firstname_Lastname.BASH. Your script and your Linux directory
structure should demonstrate that you have correctly written the script to do the following:
XI. Create files: In this section, you will demonstrate your ability to utilize various Linux commands to create text files. Create these files in the NEW
directory. Ensure that the commands in your log file show that the following three text files were created using three different methods. Create the
following files:
A. A text file listing the quantity of operating system free space, titled Free_Space_Content.txt
B. A text file listing the directory contents of the OLD folder, titled OLD_Content.txt
C. A text file showing the current month, day, and time (title this file Time_File.txt.)
XII. Modify, copy, and move files: Utilize Linux commands to copy files to a different directory and rename them.
A. Copy the following selected files from the OLD directory to the BACKUP directory. Ensure that you change the filename suffix from XXX_OLD to
XXX_BACKUP.
i. Free_Space_Content_OLD.txt
ii. Directory_Content_OLD.txt
iii. Time_File_OLD.txt
B. Move all files from the NEW directory to the BACKUP directory (no renaming necessary). Clean up the Linux directory structure by deleting the
items in the NEW directory.
XIII. Execute the script: At this point, you will need to complete and execute the newly created script and complete a successful directory backup process.
XIV. Assess output: Finally, analyze the Linux directory structure and file contents to confirm successful script implementation. Ensure that you download
your script and your Script_Assessment.txt file for submission.
A. Create a text file titled Script_Assessment.txt in the NEW directory; write a paragraph identifying the commands that you used in your script,
and assess the success of your script.
